Most image histograms show a single channel of information, whether it be red, green, or blue.  This is very useful but sometimes it is nice to see each color as RGB, together.
Build a true color image histogram by using RGB as cartesian coordinates to display.  The effect is a 3D volumetric histogram.

This project is functional by not yet version 1.  Completed items as follows:
1) binary tree as histogram.
2) UI to display image and histogram.
3) 3D rotate capability.
4) image loading
5) open and close dialog.

Items to be added to make version 1.
1) UI show color RGB value, count, total pixel count when mouse hover histogram.
2) highlight all neighborhood pixels when mouse hover histogram.
> (currently, highlights only the explict pixel color).
3) continuous spin capability.
4) reference x, y, z lines.
5) refactor code to follow MVC architecture.
